<h3 align="middle">A Tiger tank factory line. Notice how many people are crowded on one tank. Parts were hard to make making them hand made only, addintionally this production line is much slower than American ones. German factories that used steel were centered around train making didn't have convayer belts like American factories. This made production slower and less reliable.</h3>
