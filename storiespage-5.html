<h3>Battle to the death with uneven odds.</h3>

<p>1943, the battle of Kursk in Soviet Russia is well underway. The Russian 10th tank corp is heading to the SS-Heavy Panzer Divison's flank with a force of around 50 T-34's. A lone Tiger, commanded by Franz Staudegger, is heading to protect the divison's flank heads right into Russian assualt force unknowingly. As the T-34's drive up and over a hill Franz spots the hulls of the Russian tanks. The Soviet tanks are powerless to the Tiger's armour, much less the Tiger's bite. After taking out 17 tanks Franz noticed he was out of armour peircing shells he used high explosive shells to finish off 5 more T-34's. Fearing for losing a track Franz retreats from the battle to restock and repair to fight another day.</p>
