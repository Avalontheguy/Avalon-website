      <!--All these stories are very interesting, this is one Tiger tale however that I would have loved to tell. It's not a real story however, it's a historic fiction tale titled the last Tiger. It centers around tank commander Peter Muller and his crew as they defend the last bit of Nazi Germany against their Allied invaders. I don't want to spoil too much but it's one of my favorite stories, it shows the end of the war for the Germans. A lost cause but one they must complete.-->

<h2>There are many interesting tales surrounding the Tiger, while some sound like works of fiction they are true and show how powerful the Tiger is. Here are 3 tales surrounding the Tiger tank.</h2>

<h3>The tank that survived over 100 shots.</h3>

<div class="first">
<p>The Tiger was equipped with over 102mm of armour, able to bounce Allied shells it was a true beast with an aura of invincability. One such story documenting the power of such an amount of armour is the Tiger that blocked 252 shots from enemy fire. During the invasion of Russia, or Operation Citidal as titled by the Germans, Tiger 231 commanded by Second Lieutetant Zabel saw combat near Semia Nicovo. Advancing on farm land the Tiger was suddenly hit from the front, Red army defenses awating the German push with T-34's opening fire on the Tiger. Multiple hits started to rip away at parts of the Tiger not heavily defended by armor, compenets like smoke grenade launchers and viewports became damdaged beyond repair. After several more hits the Tiger could not fire anymore, a 75 mm shell shot off the turret bolts allowing fluid to leak from the tank and cause the turret to be stuck in the recoil postion. After 6 hours of constant firing the Tiger, while heavily damaged was able to retreat 60 km under it's own power. Once out of danger the Zabel and the crew tallied up the hits, an astouding 227 hits. Dr.Joesph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, used the tank to show off German engineering.</p>

<h3>Battle to the death with uneven odds.</h3>

<p>1943, the battle of Kursk in Soviet Russia is well underway. The Russian 10th tank corp is heading to the SS-Heavy Panzer Divison's flank with a force of around 50 T-34's. A lone Tiger, commanded by Franz Staudegger, is heading to protect the divison's flank heads right into Russian assualt force unknowingly. As the T-34's drive up and over a hill Franz spots the hulls of the Russian tanks. The Soviet tanks are powerless to the Tiger's armour, much less the Tiger's bite. After taking out 17 tanks Franz noticed he was out of armour peircing shells he used high explosive shells to finish off 5 more T-34's. Fearing for losing a track Franz retreats from the battle to restock and repair to fight another day.</p>
