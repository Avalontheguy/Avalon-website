<!--Some cool information here, did you know that Micheal Whittman did not have the most kills? He was famous cause he was part of the SS. The SS wanted to prove how elite they were by showing off their best tank commander. In fact it was Kurt Kinspel that had the most kills, little is known of him due to him talking back to officers and treating prisioners kindly. His commanding officers didn't like this very much and promoted him slowly and didn't bring the public eye to him.-->
