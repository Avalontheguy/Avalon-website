      <h1>Facts about the Tiger Tank</h1>
<p>The Tiger tank is an impressive product of German engineering, it combines the power of the powerful German 88cm flak cannon and 102 mm of armor. Able to punch through allied armor like paper and bounce shots from the weaker allied guns the tiger was truely unstoppable, or was it?</p>

      <h2>The Tiger was unreliable</h2>
<p>The Tiger was overengineered, the wheels for example, which were overlapping to help distribute wheight was a nightmare to repair. Often times when only 1 wheel was damaged several wheels had to be taken off just repair the one wheel. German engines and transmissions had to move 57 tons which put alot of strain on these parts, often causing overheating and breakdown of said parts. In addition to parts, factories were usally made by slave labor, often times those slaves would sabotage different parts making the parts more prone to breaking down. If a part did brake down Tiger crews often would have to go without them as spare parts were rare for the Tiger. Due to the low numbers of Tiger production and the failing german economy during the war parts would go stright into the next tank. Another factor is the fact that German factories would change production models of parts all the time making some tank parts uncompatable for older/newer Tiger models. Additionally the Tiger was a large fuel user, using 5 gallons a mile. The Tiger during the final 2 years of the war really sturggled due to major oil shortages thanks to Allied bombing. Tiger's would often have to be abandoned on the side of the road due their fuel being used up.</p>

      <h2>The Tiger had an interesting training manual</h2>
<p>An officer in the tank corps, Panzer General Hienz Guderian, created a feild manual for the Tiger. Dubbed the Tigerfibel it was fillied with jokes, puns, and pictures of women to hold the readers attention. Easy to understand and not boring to read this manual helped young tank commanders learn how to control their tank.</p>

      <h2>The Tiger was feared for a reason</h2>
<p>The Tiger was built in low numbers due to production problems. Therefore the best tanks were reserved for the best commanders.</p>
