      <h1>Facts about the Tiger Tank</h1>
<p>The Tiger tank is an impressive product of German engineering, it combines the power of the powerful German 88cm flak cannon and 102 mm of armor. Able to punch through allied armor like paper and bounce shots from the weaker allied guns the tiger was truely unstoppable, or was it?</p>

      <h2>The Tiger was unreliable</h2>
<p>The Tiger was overengineered, the wheels for example, which were overlapping to help distribute wheight were a nightmare to repair. Often times when only 1 wheel was damdged several wheels had to be taken off just repair the one wheel. German engines and transmissions had to move 57 tons which put alot of strain on these parts, often causing overheating and breakdown of said parts. Parts themselves were hard to get as Tiger factories would change parts when someone found an easier way of making parts.</p>
