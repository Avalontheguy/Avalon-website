      <h1>Facts about the Tiger Tank</h1>
<p>The Tiger tank is an impressive product of German engineering, it combines the power of the powerful German 88cm flak cannon and 102 mm of armor. Able to punch through allied armor like paper and bounce shots from the weaker allied guns the tiger was truely unstoppable, or was it?</p>

      <h2>The Tiger was unreliable</h2>
<p>The Tiger was overengineered, the wheels for example, which were overlapping to help distribute wheight was a nightmare to repair. Often times when only 1 wheel was damaged several wheels had to be taken off just repair the one wheel. German engines and transmissions had to move 57 tons which put alot of strain on these parts, often causing overheating and breakdown of said parts. </p>

      <h2>The Tiger had an interesting training manual</h2>
<p>An officer in the tank corps, Panzer General Hienz Guderian, created a feild manual for the Tiger. Dubbed the Tigerfibel it was fillied with jokes, puns, and pictures of women to hold the readers attention. Easy to understand and not boring to read this manual helped young tank commanders control their tank.</p>
